				<p>
				In Version 2.0, we added a working healthbar -- with fall damage -- and a hotkey for
				quiting the game: 'esc'.<br><br>

				There are a few known bugs:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• The quit hotkey does not work once the player has died<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Fall damage activates randomly<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Jumping into parts of the map that have not been finished crashes the game.<br><br>

				In 2.1, we have fixed both of these issues.<br>
				We did this by moving the hotkey script out of the player class, 
				and into a separate one (kind of a nobrainer).<br>
				Also, we fixed the fall damage issue by tearing it
				apart, and rebuilding it from the ground up...<br>
				<strong><i>TWICE</i></strong>.<br><br>
					
				Instead of releasing 2.1, we are going to wait for the 3.0 update
				to take some stress off my Computer.<br>
				Having the number of tabs, windows, and application I have open,
				as well as constantly building Unity builds...<br>
				That ain't healthy, my friend<br><br>
					
				In 3.0 you can expect:<br>
				<i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• A shooting mechanic,<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• A hittable model, with:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Working hitboxes<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Different damage for certain hitboxes<br>
				And much, much more planned for the future.
