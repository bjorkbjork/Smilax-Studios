				<h3 style = "margin-left:31%;text-align: center;float: left">DevBlog 3.0</h3><i style="text-align:center;float: right;margin-top:3%;">11/10/18</i><br><br>
				<p>
				In Version 3.0, we have: 
				<p style = "margin-left: 40px">• A new gun model,<br>
				• A shooting mechanic with sound effect<br>
				• Updated version of the map<br>
				• New hitboxes for the player.<br>
				• And a death screen and respawn function.<br><br></p>
				
				The new hitboxes that we added are these:<br>
				<img width="100%" src="hitboxes.PNG">
				<br>The Death screen looks like this:<br>
				<img width="100%" src="deathscreen.PNG">
				<br><i>Yes we know, it's a rip off of darksouls, it's just temporary</i><br><br>
				

				There are a few known bugs:<br>
				<p style = "margin-left: 40px">• Once the player has respawned, the line representing the bullet no longer appears from the gun, it appears from the characters head.<br>
				• Sometimes when respawing your health is still set to 0<br>
				• Jumping into parts of the map that have not been finished still crashes the game.<br><br></p>

				In 3.0, we attempted to make a working AI, but after the Head Programmer tearing his hair out, we decided that we would
				just release what we had, and keep the AI for the next update...<br><br>
				
				<i>ALPHA 1.0!<br><br>
				In Alpha 1.0, you can expect:<br>
				<p style = "margin-left: 40px">
				• A basic AI with pathfinding, if we have enough time we will add shooting,<br>
				• Footsteps, ambient noise, and possibly voice commands,<br>
				• A menu with settings for mouse sensitivity and such,<br><br>
				</p>
				And what ever else we decide to throw in during development!

				<p>
				In Version 2.0, we added a working healthbar -- with fall damage -- and a hotkey for
				quiting the game: 'esc'.<br><br>

				There are a few known bugs:<br></p>
				<p style = "margin-left: 40px">• The quit hotkey does not work once the player has died<br>
				• Fall damage activates randomly<br>
				• Jumping into parts of the map that have not been finished crashes the game.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
				In 2.1, we have fixed both of these issues.<br>
				We did this by moving the hotkey script out of the player class, 
				and into a separate one (kind of a nobrainer).<br>
				Also, we fixed the fall damage issue by tearing it
				apart, and rebuilding it from the ground up...<br>
				<strong><i>TWICE</i></strong>.<br><br>
					
				Instead of releasing 2.1, we are going to wait for the 3.0 update
				to take some stress off my Computer.<br>
				Having the number of tabs, windows, and application I have open,
				as well as constantly building Unity builds...<br>
				That ain't healthy, my friend<br><br>
					
				In 3.0 you can expect:<br></p>
				<i><p style = "margin-left: 40px">• A shooting mechanic,<br>
				• A hittable model, with:<br></p>
				<p style = "margin-left: 80px">• Working hitboxes<br>
				• Different damage for certain hitboxes<br></p>
				<p>
				And much, much more planned for the future.
