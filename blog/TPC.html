				<p>
				We are currently waiting on all of the Pixel Art assets to be finished by Sam.
				All of the base code has been added, and just needs some tweaking.<br>
				We are planning on launching it on Google Play for $0.99. At the moment
				there are no plans for adding advertisments, but this might change due to our financial state.
				If you have any suggestions for what you would like to see in this game -- it's currently
				just a clicker -- then email us your suggestions!<br><br>
				Pre-Alpha 1.0 is expected to have:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• All the art assets completed.<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• A working settings menu<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• A working 'E's earnt per second' feature.<br>
