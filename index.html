				<p>
				This game is a low-poly, goofy shooter set in the invasion of Gallipoli, WW1. Despite this historic setting, the game takes place on an entrily fictitious set of islands. Currently on version Pre-Alpha 2.1, expected to be updated to 3.0 within the next week. In 3.0 you can expect:<br>
				<i>• A shooting mechanic,<br>
				• A hittable model, with:<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Working hitboxes<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp• Different damage for certain hitboxes<br></i>
				And much, much more planned for the future.<br><br>

				This game is our active focus, but we are also developing...

				<p>
				This game is a comedic clicker game for iOS and Android smartphones, and is the brainchild of Sam and Francois. Serious developmemnt of this game has not started yet, as many art assets are yet to be completed. Most of our time and effort is being sunk into the main game, <a href = "#ACG">ANZAC Cove - Gallipoli</a>.<br> Pre-Alpha 1.0 is expected to have:<br>
				• All the art assets completed.<br>
				• A working settings menu<br>
				• A working '[REDACTED] earnt per second' feature.<br>
